# üíÄBruteForce FTP ServerüíÄ

## üìúDescription
The FTP Brute-Force Tool is a Python-based script designed for penetration testers and cybersecurity enthusiasts  
to audit the security of FTP servers by performing brute-force attacks.  
This tool supports multithreading for optimized performance and includes additional features  
like port scanning, wordlist generation, and logging of successful/failed attempts.  

## üîëFeatures
- Brute-Force Attack: Perform dictionary-based brute-force attacks on FTP servers with customizable delay and multithreading.  
- Port Scanning: Scan for open ports to identify potential entry points on target servers.  
- Custom Wordlist Generator: Easily create targeted wordlists combining base words and years.  
- Attack Logs: Automatically saves results of successful and failed attempts in a log file for future reference.  
- Interactive Menu: User-friendly menu-driven interface for seamless navigation.  
- Banner & UX: Displays a detailed banner and cleans the screen for an optimal user experience.  

## üöÄStep-by-Step Guide in Linux Terminal !

Step 1: Update & upgrade your system  
>sudo apt update  
>sudo apt upgrade  

Step 2: Clone the repository  
>git clone https://github.com/The-Real-Virus/BruteForce-FTP-Server.git  

Step 3: Go to the Tool Directory where u clone it and read requirements.txt file !  
>cd BruteForce-FTP-Server  
(read requirements.txt file using cat or gedit)  

Step 4: extract the rockyou file using unrar  
>sudo apt install unrar (if it is not installed in ur kali linux)  
>unrar x rockyou.rar  

Step 5: After Completing the process now u can run script  
>python3 Script.py  

## ‚öôÔ∏èTroubleshooting

1) `UnicodeDecodeError when reading password files:`  
- Use a password file encoded in latin-1 or ensure compatibility by re-saving the file with proper encoding.  

2) `Permission Denied Errors:`  
- Ensure you have appropriate privileges to run the script (e.g., sudo on Linux).  

3) `Connection Issues:`  
- Verify the target FTP server is reachable, and the IP address/domain is correctly entered.  
- Ensure firewalls or network restrictions do not block access to the target server.  

4) `Missing Libraries:`  
- Install all required dependencies (read requirements.txt file).  

## üí°Tips !
- Use the port scanning feature(nmap is best) to identify open FTP ports before initiating brute-force attacks.  
- Select a smaller wordlist for testing purposes on slower systems or networks to save time.  
- Use multithreading for faster attacks, but be mindful of the target server's rate-limiting or anti-brute-force measures.  
- Always check the attack log to track progress and review results after completing an attack.  

## ü§ùFollow the Prompts !
1) Enter the FTP server IP address or domain.  
2) Specify the username for the brute-force attack.  
3) Provide the password file location.  
4) Choose additional options like delay between attempts and the number of threads.  

## üõ†Ô∏èMODIFICATION ( use own wordlist )

if u want to use ur own wordlist instead of rockyou.txt , u can modify in the script ,  

Step 1: create ur own wordlist  

Step 2: move it into the BruteForce-FTP-Server Directory ( deleting rockyou is not necessory )  

Step 3: While running the script , it ask for password file then type the name of ur own created list .  

## üìÇExample OutPut
	Enter the FTP server IP address or domain (e.g., 192.168.1.1): 192.168.30.12
	Enter the username to brute-force (e.g., admin): admin
	Enter the path to the password file (e.g., rockyou.txt): rockyou.txt
	Enter delay between attempts in seconds (0 for no delay): 0
	Enter the number of threads to use (default 1): 5

	[*] Target FTP Server: 192.168.30.12
	[*] Username: admin
	[*] Passwords loaded: 14344393
	
	[1/14344393] Trying password: admin123
	[2/14344393] Trying password: password123
	...
	[+] Success! Password found: admin1234
	[+] Login successful for user 'admin' with password 'admin1234'
	
	[!] Brute-force attack completed. Logs saved in 'ftp_bruteforce_log.txt'
	
	Enter target IP address to scan: 192.168.30.12
	Enter the port range to scan (e.g., 20-1025): 20-100

	[*] Scanning target: 192.168.30.12
	[*] Scanning ports 20 to 100...
	
	[+] Open FTP Port Found: 21
	[!] Port scanning completed.
	
	[+] Attack Log:
